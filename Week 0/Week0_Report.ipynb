        "# Week 0 Report\n",
        "The main goal was to get comfortable with Python and its libraries to use for financial systems and understand how randomness enters financial markets and how it can be modeled using probability, statistics, and simulation. Through Python exercises and a mini project, we explored how uncertain market behavior can be represented using stochastic models rather than deterministic rules.\n",

        "\n",
        "The week began with revising Python concepts useful for quantitative work, including control flow, functions, imports, and basic use of libraries. NumPy was used for numerical computation and random number generation, while Pandas was used for handling financial time series data. We worked with realistic financial datasets that contain noise and missing values. Techniques such as handling NaNs, resampling data, and using rolling windows were explored. By plotting return histograms and rolling volatility, we observed volatility clustering periods where markets remain calm followed by periods of high uncertainty.\n",

        "This highlighted that market risk is not constant and changes over time. Visualization plays an important role in identifying such patterns before applying more advanced models.\n",

        "\n",
        "Key probability and statistics concepts were reviewed, including expectation, variance, and covariance. Expectation represents average outcomes, variance measures uncertainty or risk, and covariance describes how different assets move together. The normal distribution and z scores were introduced as standard tools for analyzing returns and deviations from the mean.\n",

        "\n",
        "A discrete random walk models movement as random steps over time. As time steps become smaller, this process converges to Brownian motion, a continuous time stochastic process. Since Brownian motion can take negative values, it cannot model prices directly. By exponentiating Brownian motion, we obtain Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), which ensures prices remain positive.\n",
        "\n",
        "As part of the mini project, a GBM simulator was implemented using Python used to generate several possible future price paths from the same starting value. The resulting plots showed that prices can evolve very differently due to randomness alone. A histogram of final prices emphasized that outcomes should be understood as distributions rather than single predictions.\n",

        "\n",
        "Financial markets are best modeled as stochastic systems. Asset pricing models do not aim to predict exact future prices but instead describe the range of possible outcomes and their probabilities. GBM provides a simple framework for linking stochastic motion to asset prices. This probabilistic approach is central to quantitative finance and underlies many pricing and risk models.\n",

        "\n",
        "Monte Carlo simulation is a key tool in quantitative finance. It works by generating many possible future scenarios and analyzing their outcomes. In option pricing, simulated price paths are used to compute payoffs, and the average payoff gives an estimate of the option's value. The core idea behind Monte Carlo methods are using randomness and repetition to estimate distributions of future outcomes.\n",
